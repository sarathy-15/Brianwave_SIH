 Six Pot Saver – Digital Budgeting

📌 Overview
The Six Pot Saver is a digital budgeting system inspired by the "6 Jars Money Management Method."  
It helps users allocate their income into six categories (pots) automatically, track spending, and visualize progress.  
This tool is designed for people who want a simple yet powerful way to master their personal finances and achieve financial freedom.  

🏦 The Six Pots
1. Necessities (55%) – Daily living expenses such as food, rent, utilities, and transport.  
2. Financial Freedom (10%) – Investments, savings, and assets to build long-term wealth.  
3. Education (10%) – Courses, books, and learning to grow skills.  
4. Long-Term Savings (10%) – Big purchases, emergencies, or future planning.  
5. Play (10%) – Fun activities, entertainment, or leisure without guilt.  
6. Give (5%) – Donations, charity, and helping others.  

Percentages are configurable in the project.
