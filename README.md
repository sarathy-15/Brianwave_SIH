💰 Six Pot Saver: Smart Alert System for Secure Rural Banking

🧭 Overview

Six Pot Saver is a smart alert and monitoring system built to make rural banking more secure and trustworthy.

It helps protect users from fraud, unauthorized access, and suspicious transactions through real-time alerts, AI-based monitoring, and simple communication tools designed for low-connectivity areas.
